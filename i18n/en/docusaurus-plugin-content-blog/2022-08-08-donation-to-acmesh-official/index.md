:::note Preface
As the world's most popular ACME client, it has been born with the 3rd-party lexion API to solve SSL certificate DNS automation, and has been integrated with over 140 dynamic DNS providers now days, the most reason for this is that it is popular.

From our investigation, ACME.sh was born 7 years ago, starting that day, its creator: Neilpang handles issues averagely 4-8 hours every day, has accumulated over 28K stars, and received the public donation about $2000. In 2020, ACME.sh has been awarded ZeroSSL's ApiLayer sponsorship (the amount is not disclosed).
:::

We are so proud to announce today, we donate $1100 to ACME.sh team, which will be our first public donation; meanwhile, we announce that we will donate 10% of HiCA's every income to ACME.sh project. To finish this, we must say our thanks to HiCA's every paid users' support! And also, we'd say thank to [Neilpang](https://github.com/Neilpang) for keeping ACME.sh project and providing such a wonderful tool and very contribution to the ACME ecosystem!
