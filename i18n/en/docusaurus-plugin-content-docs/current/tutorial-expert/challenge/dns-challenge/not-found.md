# ❌ Not find your DNS provider

If you can't find your DNS provider, it mean it doesn't support ACME, due to business or technical reasons. We can only suggest you to get help from your DNS provider.

E.g:
- `dns.com`
- `juming.com`
- ~~`dns.la`~~ (Added support for `acme.sh` at August 11, 2022: [PR#4233](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/pull/4233) [提交#029c940](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/commit/029c9403c1bfc2fb179f9e1dfb246ab344b52bfd))
